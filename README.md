Welcome to the GitHub Page of the **[Research Lab for Applied and Computational Mathematics](https://www.acom.rwth-aachen.de)** at [RWTH Aachen University](https://www.rwth-aachen.de). 

We pursue mathematical research at the interface of engineering, natural and life sciences. We are eager to foster and stimulate interdisciplinary activities linking fundamental and applied research. In our view mathematical results provide the fundamental source of capability in the solutions of modern technological problems in applied disciplines.
