Welcome to the GitHub Page of the **[Research Lab for Applied and Computational Mathematics](https://www.acom.rwth-aachen.de)** at [RWTH Aachen University](https://www.rwth-aachen.de). 

### Mission

We pursue mathematical research at the interface of engineering, natural and life sciences. We are eager to foster and stimulate interdisciplinary activities linking fundamental and applied research. In our view mathematical results provide the fundamental source of capability in the solutions of modern technological problems in applied disciplines.

### Involved Projects

* [Trixi.jl](https://github.com/trixi-framework/Trixi.jl): Adaptive high-order numerical simulations of conservation laws in Julia 
* [OSPREI](https://github.com/DanielDoehring/OSPREI): Generating Optimal Stability Polynomials in Roots for Explicit time Integration
